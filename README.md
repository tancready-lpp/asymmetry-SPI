# asymmetry-SPI
Folder containing the Python codes used during my Master Thesis at Joint European Torus (Culham Centre for Fusion Energy) to analyse plasma disruption data and retrieve asymmetry relevant quantities, such as the Radiation Asymmetry Factor (RAF) and Toroidal Peaking Factor (TPF)

At the moment of writing (06/03/23) the python files are still to be "cleaned". Therefore in the very near future much editing will be performed on such files in order to make the files underastandable to everyone and not just me.
